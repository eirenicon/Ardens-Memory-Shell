# Copilot Contributions â€“ HAP OSINT Feed Refinement

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Contributor**: GitHub Copilot (OpenAI Codex lineage)  
**Reviewed by**: Arthur, Mark  
**Context**: Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP) â€“ Core Feed List Expansion & Curation

---

## Summary

This document outlines the targeted contribution made by **GitHub Copilot** to refine and optimize the OSINT intake architecture for the Hybrid Attack Panel. Focus was placed on:

- Signal-to-noise ratio improvement
- Domain precision tagging
- High-trust public intelligence sources

Copilotâ€™s output was evaluated against parallel suggestions from Claude, Gemini, and Khoj and was found to be high-signal and contextually relevant.

## Key Features of Copilotâ€™s Feed Curation Logic

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Criteria
- **Trusted Government & NGO Feeds**
- **Open-access datasets with structured tagging**
- **Security and Geopolitical Analysis Feeds**
- **Feeds with Built-in Source Reliability Metrics**

## Notable Feed Examples

| Feed Name                  | Domain                  | Notes                                |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| NATO StratCom             | Military / Influence Ops| High-trust briefings & reports       |
| Bellingcat RSS            | Conflict / Verification | OSINT pioneer, manual + AI-based     |
| OCCRP Feeds               | Corruption / Finance    | Multi-region, cross-border reach     |
| UNHCR Displacement Alerts | Migration               | Structured + geo-tagged incident flow|
| ACLED Conflict Monitor    | Global Instability      | Regional breakouts, machine-parseable|

## Copilotâ€™s Feed Ranking Heuristic

Copilot proposed a weighting system based on:

1. **Signal Strength**: Relevance + specificity to emerging threats  
2. **Update Frequency**: Real-time to 24hr lag  
3. **Source Trustworthiness**: Public track record + institutional transparency  
4. **Parsing Reliability**: Ease of structured extraction (RSS/JSON/GeoJSON availability)

---

## Evaluation Outcome

- âœ… Copilot returned the **cleanest initial matrix** of any AI contributor.
- âœ… Tagging logic was **interoperable** with Claudeâ€™s domain gap matrix.
- âœ… Feed list aligns well with planned **HAP parsing architecture** (Memory Shell ingestion modules).

## Integration Notes

- Added under: `Ardens Wiki > OSINT Tracker > Core Feed Curation`  
- Synergistic with: `Claude Feed Gap Grid`, `Khoj Report-Based Sources`, `Gemini Institutional Layer`

---

## Suggested Action

- Implement Copilotâ€™s **weighting logic** as a pre-processing module for feed triage  
- Translate feed list into Memory Shell-compatible `sourcecards.yaml` format  
- Begin live tests with Copilot+Claude harmonized intake layer
