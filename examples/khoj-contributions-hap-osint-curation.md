## Summary of Contribution

Khoj emphasized **context-rich, semi-structured intelligence** over stream-fed noise. Its approach focuses on **high signal density**, **historical relevance**, and **non-English sources**, curated with human-AI hybrid awareness. Unlike Claude (regional scaffolding) or Gemini (institutional depth), Khoj proposed a **curatorial intelligence strategy** focused on **latent signals and meta-reporting sources**.

## Strategic Filters: Signal over Volume

Khoj’s inclusion logic is guided by:
- **Source Provenance:** Prefers regional analysts, NGOs, and journalism collectives with known ground access
- **Linguistic Context:** Emphasis on Arabic, Russian, Farsi, Spanish, Urdu, Pashto, Hausa sources
- **Meta-Signal Coverage:** Includes second-order OSINT collections that *report on reporters* or analyze event saturation

### Exemplar Sources Flagged:
- *Jamestown Foundation Eurasia Daily Monitor*
- *Inkyfada (Tunisia)* – investigative regional reporting
- *Bellingcat (regional feeds)* – but filtered for depth, not velocity
- *Conflict Intelligence Team (Russia)*
- *Afghanistan Analysts Network*
- *Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy*
- *Global Voices (regionally filtered by conflict relevance)*

## Feed Architecture Suggestions

Khoj outlined a **three-layer curation model**:

1. **Latent Layer:**  
   Feeds not always active, but high-value when triggered (e.g. wartime scholars, diaspora analyst blogs)

2. **Pattern Recognition Layer:**  
   Pulls from feed aggregators and archives (Wayback, Archive.Today, LibGen) for retroactive analysis

3. **Human-Machine Context Loop:**  
   Feeds best ingested via a “summary+annotation” cycle with rotating human review

| Element                  | Khoj Emphasis                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Language Diversity       | Non-Anglophone majority intake                 |
| Curatorial Strategy      | Signal-dense, manually triangulated sources    |
| Data Flow Mode           | Pull-based (deliberate curation)               |
| Context Strategy         | Hybrid context layers with embedded metadata   |
| Feed Dynamics            | Event latency accepted in favor of relevance  |

## Integration Notes

Arthur noted Khoj’s strategy aligns well with:
- Deep-dive panels (e.g. migration, shadow finance)
- HAP long-tail synthesis (for Memory Shell reporting)
- Conflict-embedded historiography (Radiance-track artifacts)

Khoj’s layered approach is expected to augment—but not rep
