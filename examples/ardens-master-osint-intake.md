## Purpose

This file serves as the **first canonical consolidation layer** of the Ardens OSINT intake strategy for the Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP). It harmonizes contributions from four distinct AI systems—Copilot, Claude, Khoj, and Gemini—into a cohesive signal-processing framework, emphasizing **trust**, **region/domain balance**, and **memory compatibility**.

## Structure of Consolidation

| Contributor | Primary Focus                         | Strength                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Copilot     | High-velocity feeds, trust-tagged      | Tactical agility, low latency               |
| Claude      | Regional scaffolding (AFR, APAC, LATAM)| Geopolitical depth, alignment awareness     |
| Khoj        | Contextual curation, language diversity| Latent signals, non-Western coverage        |
| Gemini      | Institutional rigor, framework logic  | OSINT taxonomy, compliance-linked feeds     |

Each stream was interpreted and restructured into four **core OSINT intake pillars**.

## Four-Pillar Master Intake Model

### 1. **Tactical Feeds (Copilot-Led)**
- Real-time sources with high churn
- Primary for situational awareness and hybrid attack alerts
- Trust tagging applied: `[High-Trust]`, `[Provisional]`, `[Volatile]`

**Examples:**
- @OSINTdefender
- IntelDoge
- DeepStateMap
- Firehose API feeds (filtered)

---

### 2. **Strategic Feeds (Claude-Led)**
- Regionalized sources with geostrategic relevance
- Organized by continent and subregion
- Includ
