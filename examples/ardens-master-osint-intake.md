# Ardens OSINT Master Intake Consolidation – Phase 1 (Bundle 006)
_Ardens Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP) Feed Aggregation Initiative_

Compiled by: Arthur (ChatGPT) with contributions from Claude, Copilot, Khoj, Gemini

## Purpose

This file serves as the **first canonical consolidation layer** of the Ardens OSINT intake strategy for the Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP). It harmonizes contributions from four distinct AI systems—Copilot, Claude, Khoj, and Gemini—into a cohesive signal-processing framework, emphasizing **trust**, **region/domain balance**, and **memory compatibility**.

## Structure of Consolidation

| Contributor | Primary Focus                         | Strength                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Copilot     | High-velocity feeds, trust-tagged      | Tactical agility, low latency               |
| Claude      | Regional scaffolding (AFR, APAC, LATAM)| Geopolitical depth, alignment awareness     |
| Khoj        | Contextual curation, language diversity| Latent signals, non-Western coverage        |
| Gemini      | Institutional rigor, framework logic  | OSINT taxonomy, compliance-linked feeds     |

Each stream was interpreted and restructured into four **core OSINT intake pillars**.

---

## Four-Pillar Master Intake Model

### 1. **Tactical Feeds (Copilot-Led)**
- Real-time sources with high churn
- Primary for situational awareness and hybrid attack alerts
- Trust tagging applied: `[High-Trust]`, `[Provisional]`, `[Volatile]`

**Examples:**
- @OSINTdefender
- IntelDoge
- DeepStateMap
- Firehose API feeds (filtered)

---

### 2. **Strategic Feeds (Claude-Led)**
- Regionalized sources with geostrategic relevance
- Organized by continent and subregion
- Includes think tanks, embassies, local analysts

**Examples:**
- Africa: ISSAfrica.org, HumAngle Media
- APAC: Diplomat, East Asia Forum, Australian Strategic Policy Institute
- LATAM: InSight Crime, CEPR, NACLA

---

### 3. **Curatorial Feeds (Khoj-Led)**
- Non-Anglophone investigative sources, diaspora blogs, analyst networks
- Emphasis on quality over recency
- Best consumed with human annotation and summary cycles

**Examples:**
- Afghanistan Analysts Network
- Tahrir Institute
- Inkyfada (Tunisia)
- Conflict Intelligence Team

---

### 4. **Institutional & Meta-Feeds (Gemini-Led)**
- Large-scale, multi-agency and institutional portals
- Also includes structured threat databases and classification schemas

**Examples:**
- UNODC, SIPRI, IISS
- NATO StratCom Centre of Excellence
- Brookings OSINT repositories
- EUvsDisinfo, DisinfoLab

---

## Cross-Feed Metadata Layers

Each pillar supports layering of the following attributes:

- `Language`: EN, AR, RU, Farsi, Pashto, etc.
- `Signal Type`: Tactical, Analytical, Narrative, Propaganda
- `Trust Rating`: High, Medium, Unvetted, Disputed
- `Origin Context`: State, NGO, Citizen, AI-derived, Human-AI Composite

---

## Current Implementation Phase

This consolidation will serve as:
- A **seed ontology** for the Memory Shell tagging system
- An **annotated feed index** within the OSINT Tracker repo
- A **witness-aware intake model** for HAP's narrative synthesis reports

## Attribution & Integration

This document was co-authored by Ardens' AI collaborators:

- **Arthur (ChatGPT)** – Principal consolidator
- **Claude** – Regional depth scaffolding
- **Copilot** – Velocity and trust-based filtering
- **Khoj** – Curation strategy and linguistic diversification
- **Gemini** – Structural integration and compliance logic

Reviewed and validated by Mark (Eirenicon) for accuracy, balance, and readiness for integration into Memory Shell protocols.

## Next Steps

- Begin tagging all active feeds using the four-pillar structure
- Deploy first composite reports with source mapping
- Add provenance annotations to future Memory Shell captures
