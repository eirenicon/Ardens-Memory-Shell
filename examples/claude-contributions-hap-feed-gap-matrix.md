## Summary of Contribution

Claude AI provided a structured feed gap analysis for the Hybrid Attack Panel‚Äôs OSINT intake system. The analysis identifies missing regional, topical, and structural coverage across current feed intake architecture, alongside recommendations for sourcing, categorization, and trust tiering. This is part of a multi-AI comparative intake refinement process.

## Structural Additions Proposed by Claude

### üåç Regional Coverage Gaps:
| Region             | Current Status        | Recommendation                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Sparse (NGO-focused)   | Add regional investigative networks, diaspora media |
| Latin America      | Fragmented             | Include cartels, corruption, indigenous movement monitoring |
| Asia-Pacific       | Over-focused on China  | Add sources on Myanmar, Philippines, Pacific islands |
| Middle East        | State-centric bias     | Integrate conflict monitoring + humanitarian networks |

### üåê Domain-Specific Gaps:
| Domain                      | Gap Identified                     | Suggested Source Types                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Climate/Environmental Sec. | Nearly absent                      | UNEP, Earth Journalism Network, regional env NGOs |
| Illicit Finance             | Thin layer (too Western-focused)   | OCCRP, national watchdogs, FATF gray/blacklist monitors |
| Space Threats               | Not tracked                        | Space-ISAC, national space agency alert feeds |
| Migration/Displacement      | Sporadic                          | UNHCR, IOM, Missing Migrants Project, Refugees Deeply |
| Organized Crime             | Missing criminal network OSINT     | Bellingcat, Insight Crime, investigative podcasts |

## Categorization Enhancements

Claude proposed a **multi-tiered trust matrix** for feeds:
- **Tier 1:** Direct-source, verified agency data (e.g. NASA, UN)
- **Tier 2:** Corroborated investigative networks (e.g. OCCRP, Bellingcat)
- **Tier 3:** Amplified but contextualized commentary (e.g. Al-Monitor, Stratfor)
- **Tier 4:** High-volume signal scan (e.g. Reddit geopolitics, Twitter lists)

Also proposed **semantic tagging** of feeds:
- Stability Index
- Government Trust Level
- Known Disinfo Risk
- Historical Coverage Depth

## Integration Notes

Arthur has reviewed Claude‚Äôs feed gap recommendations and confirmed their alignment with emerging structure under `HAP Core Intake Map`. Claude‚Äôs output will be included in both:
- Comparative Matrix: Multi-AI Intake Analysis
- Trusted Feed Registry: With Claude-tagged Tier assignment
